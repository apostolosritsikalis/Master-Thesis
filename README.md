# Master-Thesis
This thesis deals with the representation, analysis and training of robotic dynamic models with the help of Artificial Neural Networks

There have been made 3 training models of Neural Networks with the help of KNIME Analutics Platform, that took data from 4 robotic systems (Franka,BaxterRand,BaxterRhytmic and URpickNplace) and made the training.The results of the training realized with the represantation of the training loss with plots and the represantation of the MSE with boxplots.The 3 robotic datasets BaxterRand,BaxterRhytmic and URpickNplace it was ready and take it from the internet from an open source site for datasets (Kaggle).The franka dataset it has been made by using RobotDart and load this robot system.It have been programmed to do some moves at the space and the data of doing this has been taken to create the dataset.

Requieremnts: Linux, Python3, Matplotlib, RobotDart
